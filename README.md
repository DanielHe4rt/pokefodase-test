## :heart: 2 minutes quick start

## :computer: Running the server

:bulb: Run the server on the command line just typing the following command:
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```
After that it will show at the terminal something like that:
```
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
[Thu Feb 11 23:07:51 2021] PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started
```

Now you can the link on the browser and you will see the application running!
